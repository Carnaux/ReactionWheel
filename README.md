# Reaction Wheel


The ideia of the project was to analyze how the forces work when circular motion is added. 


# Parts

- Arduino UNO
- MPU-6050 Accelerometer + Gyro
- 3d printed parts
- 9v toy motor

# Results

Unfortunately the motor doesn't respond fast enougth to equilibrate the system. But the sensors were precise to identify the changes in position and rotation.
